# Quiz-system-using-Assembly-language-68
Created an interesting quiz system. Anyone can judge himself within a short time by this quiz system.

In this game, we have set 10 questions. For each right answer 1 mark will be increased and for each wrong answer 1 mark will be decresed from total points and at the end of the quiz total marks will be shown.

The ASM file can be opened with notepad extension and the code will be visible.
